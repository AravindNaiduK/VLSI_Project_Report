# Design and Analysis of a Master Slave Synchronous D-Flipflop for 3-bit Asynchronous Down Counter
Design and analysis part were done by using CMOSIS5 600nm Technology in Cadence tool.
Synchronous Master Slave D-Flip-flop is designed by using minimum transistor sizes for the gates at both schematic and layout level implementation and analysis of the designed flip-flop did by cal- culating hold times, setup time, and clock to Q delay at different capacitive loading conditions and at different transistor widths.
Implemented the 3-bit Asynchronous down Counter by using the designed flip-flop and got the simulated results.
